## 🦾 What I do

I design and build **reasoning, memory, and safety layers for robots** — systems that sit *between planning and execution* and make robot behavior more reliable, predictable, and compliant in the real world.

My focus is **emerging Physical AI**: robots that must operate under uncertainty, physical constraints, safety rules, and human presence — not just generate plans, but **decide responsibly**.

I work at the intersection of:
- **Robotics & Physical AI**
- **Decision-making under constraints**
- **World models & long-term memory**
- **Safety, regulation, and explainability**

## 🚀 Current focus

### **Partenit — Reasoning & Safety Layer for Robots**
Founder & CTO

At Partenit, we build a **decision and control layer** for robots that:
- evaluates actions *before execution*
- applies safety, regulatory, and physical constraints
- uses structured world knowledge instead of brittle prompt logic
- reduces unpredictable or unsafe behavior in real environments

This layer is designed for:
- humanoid and mobile robots
- safety-critical and regulated settings (warehouses, industrial sites, shared human spaces)
- long-horizon autonomy where context, memory, and compliance matter

> *I build safety-critical reasoning for robots.*

Pilots and collaborations are open.

## 🧠 Technical domains I work with

- **Physical AI & Robotics**
- **Decision Layers & Action Gating**
- **World Models & Robot Memory**
- **Ontologies & Structured Knowledge**
- **Safety Constraints & Policy Enforcement**
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**
- **Robotics + Regulation & Compliance**

Simulation and validation play a key role in my work (e.g. physics-based simulation, failure analysis, behavior verification).

## 🔬 What I’m building now

- Reasoning architectures for robots that operate under uncertainty  
- Memory systems that persist world state beyond a single task  
- Safety and compliance mechanisms integrated *into* decision-making, not added after  
- Tooling to make robot behavior **inspectable and explainable** for humans  

(Some implementation work lives in private or corporate repositories.)

## 🌍 Education & community (side mission)

Alongside engineering, I invest heavily in **education and community impact**.

- **Education Manager @ WOMEN IN TECH ® Global**  
  Supporting women entering and growing in tech through programs, mentoring, and public speaking.

- **Co-founder @ GradeBuilder**  
  An AI-assisted platform for accessible IT education and skill growth.

- **Co-founder @ Simfero**  
  AI tooling for education and structured learning experiences.

Education is not my core product — it’s how I **scale impact**, share systems thinking, and grow future engineers.

---

## 🎯 Background & mindset

- Founder-engineer with hands-on architecture and systems design experience  
- Comfortable moving between **deep technical detail** and **product vision**  
- Strong bias toward **reliability, clarity, and real-world constraints**  
- Skeptical of hype, optimistic about well-engineered Physical AI  

I believe the next leap in robotics will come not from bigger models alone, but from **better reasoning, memory, and control structures**.
